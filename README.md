There are a few parallel codes that you can run. They are very messy at the moment, so apologies!
You can run example.sage, test.sage, or genEG.sage.
These three files require cost.py and klpt_panny.py in the same folder.

The first file example.sage runs a small example to show that it works.
The second file test.sage is used to test functions.
The last file is genEG.sage which is used to generate small examples for you to use.
