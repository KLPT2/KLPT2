There are a few parallel codes that you can run. They are very messy at the moment, so apologies!

You can run example.sage, or genEG.sage.
These two files require cost.py and klpt_panny.py in the same folder.

The first file example.sage runs a small example to show that it works.

The second file is genEG.sage which is used to generate small examples for you to use.
